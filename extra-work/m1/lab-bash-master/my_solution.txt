 For every folder in lorem print the total number of characters of every file name. Try using for loop to show every file name
 	1. Print every file
 		for i in $(ls lorem)
 			do
 				echo $i
 			done
 			
 	2. Print the number of characters of every file name
 		for i in $(ls lorem)
 			do
 				wc -c lorem/$i
 			done
 			
 	3. Print the number of characters of every file name with the following format: lorem has 5 characters length
 		for i in $(ls lorem)
 			do  
 				variable=$(wc -m lorem/$i) 
 				echo "$i has $variable characters length"
 			done
 				
 Show the system processes being executed:
 	1. Using top or htop
 		top
 			It shows the system processes being executed
 	
 	2. Using ps command
 		ps -e
 			It shows all the running processes
 
 Show processor info on the screen
 	lscpu
 	
  Create 3 new alias and make them available everytime you log in your session
  	nano ~/.bashrc
  		At the end of the file you add the three alias, in my case:
  		alias ..='cd ..'
  		alias ...='../../'
  		alias lah='ls -lah'
  		
  	. ~/.bashrc
  	
  Compress lorem and lorem-copy folders in a file named lorem-compressed.tar.gz
  	tar -czvf lorem-compressed.tar.gz lorem lorem-copy
  	
  Uncompressed lorem-compressed.tar.gz in lorem-uncompressed folder
  	mkdir lorem-uncompressed
	tar -xf lorem-compressed.tar.gz -C lorem-uncompressed
